# Dog Classification
The task is to classify the dogs in the dataset represented by 50 dog breed classes.
I carried out some experiments with different ResNet CNNs fine-tuning strategies, evaluated different augmentation and regularization techniques to avoid overfitting and achieved 99% accuracy on the test set.
